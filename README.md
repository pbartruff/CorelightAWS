# CorelightAWS
Set of Terraform and Ansible scripts to deploy a simple Corelight lab environment

# Terraform scripts
Only a few scripts have been created to deploy a simple architecture.  Additionally, a varaibles file has much of the configuration, including some items that are not used.  There are no systems being deployed that will need to be monitored.  I left that for the person who is going to be using the architecture.

# Ansible scripts are coming soon

# YMMV
:-)
